touch-hover-to-link
===================

Lets say you have a website with a huge mega menu. Say this huge mega menu allows the user to hover over the menu link and see a sub-menu.  Say it also allows the user to click the link to visit the menus top level category page.  This is great and all but what about touch devices that cannot hover?  That is where touch-hover-to-link.js comes in.  With this jQuery plugin, your top level menu links will be disabled on first click allowing the sub-menu to show! If the link is clicked a second time (while the sub menu is open) it will work again as a link and continue on to that top level category page.
